<h1>Angular Nerds</h1>
<p>
  We are an international group of angular enthusiasts dedicated to being the
  best in our field. Meetings are held on a weekly basis so that we can exchange
  ideas and dissect code. At Angular Nerds we also discuss other web
  technologies in order to add to our knowledge and expertise. We go beyond
  discussions about “how to” - we challenge conventions and take our skills to
  the next level. Although we all have varying experience and objectives, we
  share a common appreciation for Angular. When you meet with us you are
  encouraged to do your own research. We strongly feel that only by trying out
  new things and going beyond your comfort level will you achieve your goals. We
  also back up our assertions by sharing a repo or live coding.

  <q>After meeting  with us you will always come away feeling more enriched and enthused.</q>
